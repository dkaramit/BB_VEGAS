A ```VEGAS``` Monte Carlo Integration project. As the name implies, it is just an implementation of the ```VEGAS``` algorithm introduced in [G. P. Lepage JOURNAL  OF COMPUTATIONAL A New Algorithm PHYSICS 27, 192-203 (1978)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021999178900049?via%3Dihub), with an additional  initial (optional) phase where the bins with the maximum contribution are subdivided. The idea is that by having a simple code, the user can easily modify it, in order to meet their needs.

This project started in [*ASAP*](https://dkaramit.github.io/ASAP), where everything is made simple. So explanation on how the algorithm works can be found there.

## To-do :
- [X] Add subdivision phase.
- [ ] Read and write grid.
- [ ] Maybe better regularization of weights?

That's it for now.

Enjoy,

Dimitris
